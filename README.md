# flask-test
This is a repository to learn how to use the Flask framework

# Requirements
1. install python 3.7.x
2. install pip
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# How to run
1. Go into the folder FlaskApp
2. Execute app.py with python 3.7.x (As administrator if neccessary as it accesses port 80, the default HTTP port)
3. Go to [http://127.0.0.1/hello/Jackson](http://127.0.0.1/hello/Jackson)

NOTE: You can put any name after http://127.0.0.1/hello/ to change the webapp's greeting!
